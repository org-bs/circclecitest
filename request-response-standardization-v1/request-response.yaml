        #### The section outlines the rules for standardizing API requests and responses and provides a comprehensive guide for designing and implementing an API with consistency. This document outlines the structure, format, and content of API requests and responses, including expected data types, parameters, and error codes. <br><br>By adhering to these guidelines, the API will benefit from increased interoperability, reliability, and maintainability, making it more user-friendly for developers and easier to integrate with. The document serves as an essential reference for documenting the API, testing its functionality, and resolving any potential issues.<br><br>
